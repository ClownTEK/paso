Paso is an installation builder for Pardus Linux.

Pardus installation system is YALI (Yet Another Linux Installer).
YALI sets up the system by pisi packages from the installation media.
Paso just builds the special package repository for installation,
it's not another installation method.

Users can install or remove packages on their systems and
create paso files for sharing. Paso files are small gzipped XML files
and thus can easily be shared, because it just contains list of packages.
Packages in the list collects from the installed Pardus system,
not from Internet repositories.

Everybody can build iso images on their own system by the Paso build process.
Paso searches the packages from local resources, Pardus installation CD's and
internet repositories then builds the installation repository.
