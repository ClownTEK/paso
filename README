Paso is an installation builder for Pardus Linux.

Pardus is installed by YALI (Yet Another Linux Installer).
YALI sets up the system by pisi packages from the installation media.
Paso just builds the special package repository for installation,
it's not another installation method.

Prepare process creates paso files containing repository packages 
list and special packages. Packages in the list are taken from the
installed Pardus system, not from Internet repositories.

Users can install or remove packages on their systems and
create paso files for sharing.

Every user can build iso files from paso files by the build process.
Paso build process collects the packages from local packages,
Pardus installation CD's and Internet repos.

Paso files are small tar.gz packages and thus can easily be shared.
Everybody can build iso images on their own system.
